# GPT-Jobhunter
AI-assisted job hunting application

## Overview

GPT-Jobhunter is a tool that helps streamline your job search by:
1. Finding relevant job postings
2. Matching them to your resume using AI
3. Organizing your job applications

The application uses OpenAI's embeddings to calculate similarity between your resume and job descriptions, providing a smart way to prioritize which positions to apply for.

## Features

- **Job Search**: Search for jobs across multiple platforms
- **Resume Matching**: Get AI-powered similarity scores between your resume and job listings
- **Application Tracking**: Keep track of your job applications

## Installation

Please see [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) for detailed installation instructions.

Quick start:
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/GPT-Jobhunter.git
cd GPT-Jobhunter

# Install dependencies with Poetry
poetry install

# Set up environment variables
cp .env-template .env
# Edit .env to add your API keys

# Run the application
poetry run streamlit run jobhunter/main.py
```

## Troubleshooting Zero Similarity Scores

If you're getting zero similarity scores between your resume and jobs, follow these steps:

1. Ensure the OpenAI API key is set in the environment:
   ```bash
   export OPENAI_API_KEY=your-key-here
   ```

2. Rebuild all embeddings and recalculate similarities with:
   ```bash
   poetry run python -m jobhunter.rebuild_embeddings
   ```

3. Alternatively, upload a new resume in the UI to trigger the calculation.

For more detailed troubleshooting, see [TROUBLESHOOTING.md](TROUBLESHOOTING.md).

## Docker Deployment

To run the application using Docker:

```bash
# Build the Docker image
docker build -t gpt-jobhunter .

# Run the container
docker run -p 8501:8501 -e OPENAI_API_KEY=your-key-here -e RAPID_API_KEY=your-key-here gpt-jobhunter
```
