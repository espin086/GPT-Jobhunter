That way, Atlassians have more control over supporting their family, personal goals, and other priorities. We can hire people in any country where we have a legal entity. Interviews and onboarding are conducted virtually, a part of being a distributed-first company.\nYour future team\nThe Central AI org is part of the larger Atlassian Intelligence program. Its purpose is to accelerate AI innovation across all our products and platform, provide cohesive AI experiences and setup up an Atlassian AI infrastructure for the future.\nWhile it's anticipated that the majority of AI-driven initiatives will be developed and executed by federated product teams within Atlassian, the role of Central AI is pivotal to this process. Central AI is tasked with constructing the underlying infrastructure and capacities, which are crucial for the seamless integration and optimal functionality of AI across various departments. By doing so, Central AI ensures that different teams within the organization do not work in silos but have access to a unified foundation that promotes efficiency and collaboration. Additionally, Central AI is responsible for developing some of the core shared experiences typical in the AI domain, such as search, knowledge discovery and conversation.\nAs a Senior Software Engineer in the Central AI team, you will build and maintain the core infrastructure to allow machine learning engineers and data scientists to develop, train, evaluate, deploy, and operate Machine Learning models and pipelines. You will use your software development expertise to solve difficult problems, tackling complex infrastructure and architecture challenges.\nYou will have the opportunity to lead other engineers to drive involved projects from technical design to launch. You will also collaborate with other teams and internal customers to set expectations, gather input and communicate results.\nOn your first day, we'll expect you to have\n\u2022 5+ years of experience as a software developer.\n\u2022 Fluency in at least one modern object-oriented programming language (preferably Java/Kotlin and Python).\n\u2022 Experience with Continuous Delivery and Continuous Integration.\n\u2022 Experience building and operating large scale distributed systems using Amazon Web Services (S3, Kinesis, Cloud Formation, EKS, AWS Security and Networking).\n\u2022 Experience with distributed large-scale data processing (preferably Apache Spark).\n\u2022 Basic understanding of Machine Learning projects lifecycle.\n\nIt would be great, but not required if you have\n\u2022 Expert-level with search platform, deep learning training/inference platform.\n\u2022 Experience with Databricks.\n\u2022 Experience with scaling and deploying Machine Learning models.\n\nCompensation\nAt Atlassian, we strive to design equitable, explainable, and competitive compensation programs. To support this goal, the baseline of our range is higher than that of the typical market range, but in turn we expect to hire most candidates near this baseline. Base pay within the range is ultimately determined by a candidate's skills, expertise, or experience. In the United States, we have three geographic pay zones. For this role, our current base pay ranges for new hires in each zone are:\nZone A: $229,300 - $305,700\nZone B: $206,300 - $275,100\nZone C: $190,300 - $253,700\nThis role may also be eligible for benefits, bonuses, commissions, and equity.\nPlease visit go.atlassian.com/payzones for more information on which locations are included in each of our geographic pay zones.
