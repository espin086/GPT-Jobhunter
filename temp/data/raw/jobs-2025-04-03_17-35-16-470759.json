We are hyper focused on building a product people love and continuing to evolve based on user feedback.\n\nAs a fully remote company (even before COVID!), we welcome applicants from almost anywhere. Our team collaborates synchronously mostly from 9 AM \u2013 2 PM PT and embraces asynchronous work to stay connected across time zones.\n\nJoin us on our mission to transform lives by simplifying money, together.\n\nThe Role:\n\nMonarch Money is seeking an experienced Software Engineer with a focus on Machine Learning. We are big believers in using the power of ML/AI (and in particular, GenAI) to help people process and understand their finances, as well as make plans for and automate future improvements to their financial lives.\n\nAs one of Monarch Money's first ML engineers, you will play a key role in shaping how we integrate machine learning into our existing and future product features. Beyond technical execution, you will be a strategic thought partner, contributing to the growth of our product, company, and culture. With significant autonomy, you will own end-to-end implementation while keeping the team informed of the latest advancements in the field.\n\nIn this role, you will help shape the roadmap for ML at Monarch Money, working on impactful initiatives from day one. Early projects may include enhancing transaction enrichment using GenAI to achieve best-in-class accuracy, advancing our \"Monarch Assistant\" conversational agent, and building in-product recommendations to help users navigate their finances effortlessly. Additionally, you will explore ways to leverage ML to enhance the relationship between users and financial professionals, making financial planning more efficient and personalized.\n\nWhat You'll Do:\n\u2022 Help propose, gather and prioritize ideas on how we can harness ML to pursue Monarch's mission of improving household's personal financial lives.\n\u2022 Rapidly prototype and experiment with early ideas to assess feasibility and impact.\n\u2022 Train, evaluate, and tune ML models.\n\u2022 Work with the Product Engineering and Data teams to gather and preprocess the appropriate datasets.\n\u2022 Deploy ML models to production.\n\u2022 Help build ML infra and tooling where appropriate.\n\nWhat You'll Bring:\n\nNot all of the below are strict requirements\u2014interest/passion/intellect can often be more valuable than experience. That said, we'd love to see:\n\u2022 Experience with GenAI, including using techniques like Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and Agentic models, as well as evaluation techniques for GenAI models.\n\u2022 Experience with \"classic\" ML models (pre-GenAI), in particular ones focused on Natural Language Processing (NLP)\u2014everything from TF-IDF and SVMs to BERT and Word2Vec. Be comfortable with generating/using embeddings.\n\u2022 Great collaboration/communication skills and a sharp product sense.\n\u2022 Comfort working with large-scale data, especially sensitive.\n\nBenefits :\n\u2022 Work wherever you want!
