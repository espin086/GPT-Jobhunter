Which makes sense, they're our doorway to the most important things \u2014 through them we socialize with loved ones, work on our passion projects, and explore our curiosities. But on their own, they don\u2019t actually do a whole lot, they\u2019re kind of just there. They don\u2019t help us organize our messy lives or make it easier to compose our ideas. We believe that the browser could do so much more \u2014 it can empower and support the amazing things we do on the internet. That\u2019s why we\u2019re building one: a browser that can help us grow, create, and stay curious.\n\nTo accomplish this lofty task, we\u2019re building a diverse team of people from different backgrounds and experiences. This isn\u2019t optional, it\u2019s crucial to our mission, as we need a wide range of perspectives to challenge our assumptions and shape our browser through a bold, creative lens. With that in mind, we especially encourage women, people of color, and others from historically marginalized groups to apply.\nAbout The Role\n\nBrowsers know everything about us and what we do everyday, yet they can\u2019t predict our next move, morph themselves to better suit our tasks, or proactively reduce repetitive tasks during your work day. At The Browser Company, we\u2019re changing that by building Dia.\n\nAs a Principal Machine Learning Engineer, you\u2019ll be working alongside product engineers, designers, and our cofounder and CTO, Hursh Agrawal, to build the next LLM-powered interface for the internet. You\u2019ll collect datasets and build evals, fine-tune LLMs and smaller transformers like BERT, and iterate on our how we host models both in the cloud and on-device to improve latency and resource usage.\n\nOverall you will...\n\u2022 Fine-tune, distill, and optimize LLMs to improve performance, reduce latency, and enhance efficiency for on-device and cloud-based inference.\n\u2022 Improve our on-device model architecture, leveraging frameworks like MLX, ONNX, and TFLite to ensure models run efficiently across different devices.\n\u2022 Experiment with and integrate new LLMs, fine-tuning them for specific browser-based use cases while balancing quality, speed, and resource constraints.\n\u2022 Build evaluation pipelines to track model performance, accuracy, and real-world effectiveness over time.\n\u2022 Collaborate with product ops teams to build and improve datasets that accurately match product needs.\n\u2022 Collaborate with product engineers and designers to prototype and ship AI-powered features that enhance user experience.\n\u2022 Optimize inference strategies, including running models on-device, in the cloud, or in hybrid configurations to maximize throughput and resource usage.\n\nAfter 1 month you will...\n\u2022 Onboard to the team and codebase with your onboarding buddy\n\u2022 Attend onboarding presentations about the company, product, codebase, and culture\n\u2022 Get familiar with the Swift language, the Dia codebase, and how we ship features\n\u2022 Ship a few bug fixes and small improvements across our codebase and tooling\n\u2022 Have trained your first model, either improving an existing flow or enabling an entirely new one\n\u2022 Have pair programmed with a few people on the engineering team\n\u2022 Be regularly posting product feedback about the browser in our #dogfooding channel\n\nAfter 3 months you will...\n\u2022 Be familiar with how we prototype and build new features, working with product engineers to brainstorm ways to use models to add intelligence to Dia\n\u2022 Be familiar with our cloud infrastructure and data pipelines\n\u2022 Be familiar with how we run inference both on-device and in the cloud\n\u2022 Be testing new prototypes with existing, on-device models to test performance and viability\n\u2022 Participate in product brainstorms to think about the future of Dia\n\u2022 Be trained to interview candidates for roles at the Browser Company\n\u2022 Be contributing to on-call rotations and jumping into incidents to support the team\n\u2022 Regularly attend weekly engineering discussions about our architecture, how we do code review, code style, and more\n\nAfter 6 months you will...\n\u2022 Collaborate with our CTO and other ML and infrastructure engineers to shape the product roadmap\n\u2022 Creatively solve problems with product engineers, using pragmatic solutions ranging from basic heuristics, regressions, ML models, to AI depending on the feature\n\u2022 Own our on-device model architecture, updating it to try new models, change how we work with LoRA adapters, and optimizing it for performance and quality\n\u2022 Own our infrastructure to collect training data and fine-tune models for our use-cases\n\u2022 Have built out mechanisms to assess quality and performance, and be working with product teams to improve the efficacy of our models and heuristics\n\u2022 Drive projects from conception to production launch independently\n\u2022 Be mentoring and pair-programming with newer engineers to help them get spun up on the codebase\n\nQualifications\n\u2022 8+ years of experience optimizing and productionizing modern ML models, especially ones that run in a real-world product environment (bonus if you\u2019ve worked closely with transformer models)\n\u2022 You have deep experience fine-tuning open-source LLMs and going beyond simple LoRA fine-tuning\n\u2022 You have production experience with a modern coding language like Python\n\u2022 You're passionate about on-device performance and excited to push the boundaries of what's possible in a browser\n\u2022 You have experience independently running critical projects, shipping ML features, and leading initiatives with minimal guidance\n\u2022 You\u2019re pragmatic, motivated by nebulous problems, and excited to work in a startup environment with quick product validation cycles.\n\u2022 We\u2019re primarily focused on hiring in North American time zones and require that folks have 4+ hours of overlap time with team members in Eastern Time Zone.\n\nCompensation and Benefits\n\n\ud83d\udcb0 With our flexible compensation model, employees have the ability to choose the cash-to-equity ratio that best suits their individual needs.
